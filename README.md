# About the repository: 
This hypothetical tool efficiently ensures that your password is hard to guess. The requirements for the password is that it needs to be at least
ten characters long, have at least two uppercase letters, at least two lowercase letters, at least two digits, and at least two special characters.
To ensure further security, an additional requirement mandates that the password must be different than your five previous passwords. This hypothetical 
tool lets you know if the password is strong enough. 

# How to run the code:
